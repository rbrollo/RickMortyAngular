  <p class="fs-5">
    Hello! My name is Rog√©rio Brollo, and I am from Recife-PE, Brazil.
    Currently, I work as a QA, performing both manual and automated tests with
    Cypress. I am also a fullstack developer, with strong proficiency in PHP
    (Laravel framework) and Vue.js. I have experience with React and am
    currently working on a project in Angular to deepen my understanding of the
    tool. In the frontend context, I use Bootstrap and Tailwind as CSS
    frameworks. Additionally, I have knowledge of jQuery. On the backend, I have
    experience with Python (Django framework) and am studying C# with .NET. I am
    also capable of handling SQL databases. I have a degree in Systems Analysis
    and Development. I am always looking for learning opportunities and new
    challenges in the field of software development.
